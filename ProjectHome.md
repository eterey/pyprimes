### Generate and test for prime numbers ###

Compare a variety of algorithms for generating and testing prime numbers with the pure-Python module `pyprimes`.

Prime numbers are those positive integers which are not divisible exactly by any number other than itself or one. Generating primes and testing for primality has been a favourite mathematical pastime for centuries, as well as of great practical importance for encrypting data.

Features of `pyprimes`:

  * Produce prime numbers lazily, on demand.
  * Effective, fast algorithms including Sieve of Eratosthenes, Croft Spiral, and Wheel Factorisation.
  * Test whether numbers are prime efficiently.
  * Deterministic and probabilistic primality tests.
  * Examples of what _not_ to use are provided, including naive trial division, Turner's algorithm, and primality testing using a regular expression.
  * Factorise numbers into the product of prime factors.
  * Suitable for Python 2.5 through 3.2 from one code base.
